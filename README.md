# Blue LearningSuite #
This is a browser extension that changes the tan sidebar of BYU's new LearningSuite to blue. If you don't know what LearningSuite is this extension is not for you.
Though this extention requires permission to view all content on your LearningSuite page, no data is ever actually read from your page. In fact, no JavaScript is needed to run this extension, only a CSS file and a couple of JSON files. I promise I'm not looking at your grades.

Currently supported on Firefox.
